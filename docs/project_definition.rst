At Mozilla we have many parts that compose our Continous Integration systems.
Many of the parts of these systems have grown at different times, developed by many different
teams and not necessarily enough time to design a unified approach to them.

Mozilla CI Tools was born in order to help interact with the various parts of the CI
and accomplish much more sophisticated operations.

Various case scenarios will be described below in order to help understand the type
of solutions we want to design.

In order to understand better the data sources we use visit Data_Sources_.
