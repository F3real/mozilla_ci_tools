This helps us query information about Mozilla's Mercurial repositories.

Documentation found in here:

Important notes from the documentation:
---------------------------------------
When implementing agents that consume pushlog data, please keep in mind
the following best practices:
* Query by push ID, not by changeset or date.
* Always specify a startID and endID.
* Try to avoid full if possible.
* Always use the latest format version.
* Donâ€™t be afraid to ask for a new pushlog feature to make your life easier.
